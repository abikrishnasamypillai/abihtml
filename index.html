        <h2>INTRODUCTION :</h2>
        <p>
            Nature has provided us numerous gifts such as air, water, land, sunlight, minerals, plants, and animals. All these gifts
            of nature make our earth a place worth living. Existence on Earth would not be possible without any of these.
            Now, while these natural resources are present on Earth in plenty. Unfortunately, the necessity of most of these
            has increased extremely over the centuries due to growth in the human population.
        </p>
        <h2>What is Conservation of Nature?</h2>
        <p>
            Conservation of nature means the preservation of forests, land, water bodies, and minerals, fuels, natural gases, etc. And
            to make sure that all these continue to be available in abundance. Thus all these natural resources make life
            worth living on Earth. Life would not be imaginable without air, water, sunlight as well as other natural resources
            present on the earth.
        </p>
        <h2>Types of Natural Resources:</h2>
        <p>
            • Renewable Resources: These are resources such as air, water, and sunlight that refill naturally. • Non-Renewable Resources:
            These are resources like fossil fuels and minerals that do not restock reform very slowly. • Biotic: These originate
            from living beings and organic material like plants and animals. • Abiotic: These come from non-living things
            and non-organic material. These comprise air,water and land as well as metals like iron, copper, and silver.
        </p>
        <h2>How to Conserve Nature and Its Resources?</h2>
        <p>
            Many of the natural resources are being used at a faster rate as compared to their speed of production. There is so a necessity
            for conservation of nature and the natural resources it offers.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion :</h2>
        <p> Nature comprises of everything that surrounds us. The trees, forests, rivers, rivulets, soil, air all are the part
            of nature. Keeping nature and its resources integral. So, it is very important for the continuation of life on
            earth. It would be difficult to imagine life on earth, which has a spoiled natural environment. Therefore, taking
            appropriate steps to conserve nature in its untouched form. It must be a priority for the human race. Only human
            beings with their power and ability can save nature in its purest forms.

        <h1>DREAM DESTINATION</h1>
        <p>
            <b>Paris</b>
            ,city and capital of France, situated in the north-central part of the country. People were living on the site of the present-day
            city, located along the Seine River some 233 miles upstream from the river’s mouth on the English Channel (La
            Manche), by about 7600 BCE. The modern city has spread from the island and far beyond both banks of the Seine.

            <h2>CHARACTER OF THE CITY</h2>
        </span>
        <p>
            For centuries Paris has been one of the world’s most important and attractive cities. It is appreciated for the opportunities
            it offers for business and commerce, for study, for culture, and for entertainment; its gastronomy, haute couture,
            painting, literature, and intellectual community especially enjoy an enviable reputation. Its sobriquet “the
            City of Light” earned during the Enlightenment, remains appropriate, for Paris has retained its importance as
            a centre for education and intellectual pursuits.
        </p>
        <span>
            <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        </span>
        <p> In its centuries of growth Paris has for the most part retained the circular shape of the early city. Its boundaries
            have spread outward to engulf the surrounding towns (bourgs), usually built around monasteries or churches and
            often the site of a market. From the mid-14th to the mid-16th century, the city’s growth was mainly eastward;
            since then it has been westward. It comprises 20 arrondissements (municipal districts), each of which has its
            own mayor, town hall, and particular features. The numbering begins in the heart of Paris and continues in the
            spiraling shape of a snail shell, ending to the far east. Parisians refer to the arrondissements by number as
            the first (premier), second (deuxième), third (troisième), and so on. Adaptation to the problems of urbanization—such
            as immigration, housing, social infrastructure, public utilities, suburban development, and zoning—has produced
            the vast urban agglomeration.

        <span>
            <h2>CLIMATE</h2>
        </span>
        <p> Paris has a typical Western European oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb, although a bit more extreme, is still a typical
            climate of the category) which is affected by the North Atlantic Current. The overall climate throughout the
            year is mild and moderately wet. Summer days are usually warm and pleasant with average temperatures between
            15 and 25 °C (59 and 77 °F), and a fair amount of sunshine. Each year, however, there are a few days when the
            temperature rises above 32 °C (90 °F). Longer periods of more intense heat sometimes occur, such as the heat
            wave of 2003 when temperatures exceeded 30 °C (86 °F) for weeks, reached 40 °C (104 °F) on some days and seldom
            cooled down at night
